# Chapter 2 - Practice Set

# 1) Write a Python Program to add two numbers

# a = 40
# b = 30
# print(a+b)

# 2) Write a Python Program to find remainder when a number is divided by 2

# print(37%2)


# 3) Check the type of the Variable assigned using input() function
# checking = input("Enter Something :")
# print(type(checking))


# 4) Use Comparison  operators to find out whether a given variable a is greater than 'b' or not , Take a = 34 and b = 80

# a=34
# b=80
# print(a>b)

# 5) Write a python program to find avrage of two numbers enterd by user

# a,b  = input("Enter two numbers :").split()
# print((int(a)+int(b))/2)



# 6) Write a python program to calculate square of a number enterd by the user


a = int(input("Enter a number :"))
print(a**2)
